## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am currently working as a **Full-Stack Engineer at PREPZR**, where I build production-grade web applications with a focus on backend services, APIs, and data pipelines.

With a background in **Electrical & Electronics Engineering**, I bring a systems-level mindset to software development, prioritizing **performance, reliability, and maintainability**.

This portfolio is designed to reflect my professional approach to engineering rather than just visual design.
